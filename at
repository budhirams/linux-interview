Scheduling Jobs with at and crontab:
------------------------------------

at and crontab commands are used to schedule a job, nothing but running shell script automatically at a given time in the background.

Difference:
- at: To run job only once
- crontab: To run jobs with intervals based on requirements - basically more than once


Note: Use always complete paths for command in scripts when we want to execute a script using  at/crontab

How to check at is installed or not ?
root@kali:~# which at
/usr/bin/at
root@kali:~# command -v at
/usr/bin/at

root@kali:~# systemctl status atd

Scheduling a job using:
--------------------------
echo "completePathOfTheScript" | at <requiredTime>

Example:
   echo "/root/automation/practice_1.sh" | at 17:57
atq --- To list the scheduled jobs

To remove job
-------------------------
atrm jobid
